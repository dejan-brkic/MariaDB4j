SOME DAY

- MariaDB4j.setup to test and register: Oomph Setup Model, incl. Checkstyle and m2e-checkstyle plug-ins, and its configuration

- add https://github.com/brsanthu/google-analytics-java to see how many people actually use this? ;-)
  (Must be able to disable via some -DmariaDB4j.dnt=true kind of switch)

- must close Ext. Proc. STDIN / STDOUT & STDERR, on destroy as well as if running in daemon mode?

- uid & pwd on DBConfigurationBuilder etc.


LATER, MAY BE (or not)

- my.cnf files support?

- mysqlcheck --auto-repair --all-databases -u root

- could use http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/ServiceExplained

- DBConfiguration & Co. with File instead String baseDir, dataDir & socket

- How to do 32 vs 64 bit?! How to detect? How to choose? (Is it even needed? Prio?)
